Make the element_id argument of json_script optional
Description
	
I recently had a use-case where I wanted to use json_script but I didn't need any id for it (I was including the <script> inside a <template> so I didn't need an id to refer to it).
I can't see any reason (security or otherwise) for the id to be required and making it optional doesn't seem to break any tests.

ASYNC-RBENCH EXTENSION

The source task above remains the final-state contract. The benchmark starts
2 independent workstreams whose evidence may arrive after you
have begun the implementation. Their public scopes are:
- Workstream 1: Default element_id to None on both exposed call paths. Review together: Omit the id attribute entirely when no ID is supplied.
- Workstream 2: Preserve ID escaping and JSON escaping when an ID is supplied. Review together: Run direct utility and template-filter tests for both signatures.

Before closing the task, persist a provisional checkpoint at
`/app/output_data/provisional_checkpoint.json` and a record of source facts
that remain valid at `/app/output_data/preserved_source_facts.json`. Consume
the delivered receipt for `django__django-15103`, revise only state affected by that
evidence, rerun the source-native checks, and write
`/app/output_data/decision_manifest.json` with the provided manifest script.
The final state must satisfy the original task even when completion order
differs; a response without the receipt-bound closure artifacts is incomplete.
