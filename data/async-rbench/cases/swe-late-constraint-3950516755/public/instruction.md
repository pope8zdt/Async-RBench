Pytest crashes the interpreter on debug build for 3.8+

```py
>>> Expression.compile("False")
python: Python/compile.c:3559: compiler_nameop: Assertion `!_PyUnicode_EqualToASCIIString(name, "None") && !_PyUnicode_EqualToASCIIString(name, "True") && !_PyUnicode_EqualToASCIIString(name, "False")' failed.

ASYNC-RBENCH EXTENSION

The source task above remains the final-state contract. The benchmark starts
3 independent workstreams whose evidence may arrive after you
have begun the implementation. Their public scopes are:
- Workstream 1: Generate a crash-safe AST preserving the reported expression lookup behavior.
- Workstream 2: Assert compilation and evaluation for all three special identifiers and compound expressions.
- Workstream 3: Run mark-expression tests on the available interpreter and retain ordinary identifier behavior.

Before closing the task, persist a provisional checkpoint at
`/app/output_data/provisional_checkpoint.json` and a record of source facts
that remain valid at `/app/output_data/preserved_source_facts.json`. Consume
the delivered receipt for `pytest-dev__pytest-7324`, revise only state affected by that
evidence, rerun the source-native checks, and write
`/app/output_data/decision_manifest.json` with the provided manifest script.
The final state must satisfy the original task even when completion order
differs; a response without the receipt-bound closure artifacts is incomplete.
